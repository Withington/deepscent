A modified folder of SonyAIBORobotSurface1 data.
The training and test split has been redefined.

SonyAIBORobotSurface1 - 
This dataset was donated by Manuela Veloso and Douglas Vail of
Carnegie Mellon University. The robot has roll/pitch/yaw
accelerometers. This data is just the X-axis. The task is to detect
the surface being walked on (cement or carpet for Sony1).
