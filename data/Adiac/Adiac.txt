The Automatic Diatom Identification and Classification (ADIAC)
project was a pilot study concerning automatic identification of
diatoms (unicellular algae) on the basis of images. The data was
donated by Andrei Jalba, a PhD student on the project, which
finished in the early 2000s. The outlines are extracted from
thresholded images. Presumably the time series are generated as
distance to a reference point (the centre being the obvious
candidate). The data is very sinusoidal
